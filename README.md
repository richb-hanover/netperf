# Welcome to the Netperf Homepage

Netperf is a benchmark program that can be used to measure the performance of many different types of networking. It provides tests for both unidirectional throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments currently measureable by netperf include:

* TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets for both IPv4 and IPv6
* DLPI
* Unix Domain Sockets
* SCTP for both IPv4 and IPv6 

Netperf is designed to be available on a multiplicity of platforms, including: Unix - at least all the major variants; Linux; Windows; macOS, and others.


## Current Version

The current version of netperf is 2.7.0, released in July 2015.
The fact that it has not needed any updates is an indication of its stability and reliability.

> ... netperf, on the other hand, has been stable for a very long time, its flaws are well understood, and as such it is generally the preferred test driver of the linux kernel community.

Happy Benchmarking!

Non-trivial and very appreciated assistance comes from others
in the network performance community, who are too numerous to mention here.
While it is often used by them, netperf is NOT supported
via any of the formal Hewlett-Packard support channels.

modifications to netperf to suit your nefarious porpoises,
so long as you stay within the guidelines of the netperf copyright.
